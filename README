== browser_cms thumbnail extension

This extension adds a "thumbnail" view helper that takes an content_block with an attachment (an ImageBlock or a custom content block) and creates a thumbnail according to the ImageMagick geometry you specify.

* Supports png, jpg, gif, and bmp formats. Thumbnails are output in jpg format.
* The default geometry is "100x100" - so no side larger than 100 pixels.  
* It caches these thumbnails in the directory RAILS_ROOT/public/bcms_thumbnail_cache/. It will create this directory automatically if it doesn't exist.
* Use the "bcms_thumbnail:clear" rake task to clear the thumbnail cache.
* Thumbnails are public. They are served directly off the filesystem.

== Example markup 

Below is the minimal case that demonstrates creating a thumbnail. This overrides the default 100x100 geometry and creates images of no larger than 125 pixels on any side. 

Add a dynamic portlet and the add this to the template:
  <% image = ImageBlock.find(:first) %>
  <%= image_tag(thumbnail(image,'125x125')) %>

== Example geometries

ImageMagick will preserve aspect ratio with all the below geometries: 
 * "125" will ensure the width is no more than 125px.
 * "x125" will ensure the height is no more than 125px.
 * "125x125" will ensure neither side is more than 125px.
 * "50%" will scale the image to half its size.

== Todo

* Decache thumbnails when image attachments change via a monkey-patch on the bcms core attachment features.
* Hook image de-caching into the page de-caching control built into the bcms backend.
* Beef up the thumbnail helper to expose more mini_magick features.
* Better error reporting and sanity checking. 

== Requires

 * ImageMagick
 * mini_magick >= 1.2.5
